## Installation

Clone repository or unpack the tar ball and install with
[setuptools](http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/index.html) (note: if
you don't have setuptools installed you will need an internet
connection so that the installation procedure can sownload the
required files):

    cd propka-3.1
    python setup.py install --user

This will install the `propka31` script in your executable directory,
as configured for setuptools, for instance `~/.local/bin`. You can
change the bin directory with the `--install-scripts` option. For
example, in order to install in my `bin` directory in my home
directory:

    python setup.py install --user --install-scripts ~/bin
